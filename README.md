# AIPA

This repository is a pilot project for implementing a multi-layered feedforward neural network with backpropagation, for the purpose of deeper understanding. 
The bulk of the entrypoint in this test project starts [here](https://github.com/CLnxn/aipa/blob/master/src/models/n_classifier/training.py).

Inspired by the math of [backpropagation](https://brilliant.org/wiki/backpropagation/)
